# Project Euler

This repository contains my solutions to [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) problems.

*Currently, the solutions are only in Python.*

## Getting started

Use the `run.sh` script to compute the solution of a problem.

The following command will compute the solution for the n th problem:

```
./run.sh n
```

Note: For `n = 0`n the script will launch the tests of the library.

## Repository organisation

- `src/problems`: contains all the python files to resolve the problems.
- `src/lib`: contains different functions that are used to resolve the problems.
